 - experience in handling multiple dev and test teams with different tech stack for troubleshooting, coordination, defect triage & successful delivery of features in production

 - helped & mentored team members in learning new technologies and how to implement those quickly within their respective projects

 - performed ETL (Extract, Transform & Load) testing using custom build C# automated framework to test SQL stored procedures, Azure Data factory pipelines for data flow validation from source to target post transformation as per business logic


 - written automated test scripts in Databricks notebooks to tests migration of historical data from Cosmos DB to Azure SQL database & integrated them in CI pipeline using

```markdown
    - ✅ Python
    - ✅ Azure Pipelines
    - ✅ Azure Databricks
```


 - enhanced automation framework to continuously test incremental developments for daily data loading and transformation


 - created and plugged automated acceptance tests (scripted using Transact-SQL queries ) in Test/UAT & Production environment for daily ETL loading of facts and dimension tables


 - worked using Agile methodologies with sprint ceremonies and management using tools like 

```markdown
    - ✅ JIRA, Confluence, Trello, BigBucket GIT and Jenkins-CI
```


 - created & maintained end-2-end behaviour driven development (BDD) automation framework using Cucumber integration over Selenium WebDriver-Java from ground up
